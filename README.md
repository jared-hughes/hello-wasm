## About

This is a "Hello world"-style repository supporting:

1. Building Rust code into wasm using `wasm-pack`
2. Interfacing with the Rust code from JS using the bindings generated by `wasm-pack`.
3. Deploying the built project. It gets copied to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository, where Github Pages can serve it.

Warning: looks like the `wasm-pack` install script is not versioned, so in theory there could be a breaking change to the `wasm-pack` compiler. It points to the 0.12.1 compiler at time of writing.

Note that the deployer (`JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`), which copies the public directory to the `gh-pages` branch, ignores everything specified in `.gitignore`. In particular, `.gitignore` must not contain `pkg` (but it should contain `public`).

## Building for web

Dependency: `cargo install wasm-pack` (v0.12.1)

To build, run

```sh
./build.sh
```

This builds a static set of files into the `public/` directory. Then serve the files, e.g.

```
python3 -m http.server -d public
```

Open `index.html` on the server, and it should alert.
